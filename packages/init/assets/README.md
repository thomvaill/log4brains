# Architecture Decision Records

ADRs are automatically published to our Log4brains architecture knowledge base:

ðŸ”— **<http://INSERT-YOUR-LOG4BRAINS-URL>**

Please use this link to browse them.

## Development

If not already done, install Log4brains:

```bash
npm install -g log4brains
```

To preview the knowledge base locally, run:

```bash
log4brains preview
```

In preview mode, the Hot Reload feature is enabled: any change you make to a markdown file is applied live in the UI.

To create a new ADR interactively, run:

```bash
log4brains adr new
```
