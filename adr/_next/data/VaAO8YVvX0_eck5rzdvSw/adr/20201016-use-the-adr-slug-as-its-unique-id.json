By Date field, in the markdown file (if present)\n2. By Git creation date (does not follow renames)\n3. By file creation date if no versioned yet\n4. By slug\n\nThe core library is responsible for sorting.\n\n## Links\n\n- Supersedes <AdrLink slug=\"20200926-use-the-adr-number-as-its-unique-id\" status=\"superseded\" title=\"Use the ADR number as its unique ID\" />\n"},"creationDate":"2020-11-30T16:58:02.000Z","lastEditDate":"2020-11-30T16:58:02.000Z","lastEditAuthor":"Thomas Vaillant","publicationDate":"2020-10-16T21:59:59.000Z","file":{"relativePath":"docs/adr/20201016-use-the-adr-slug-as-its-unique-id.md","absolutePath":"/home/runner/work/log4brains/log4brains/docs/adr/20201016-use-the-adr-slug-as-its-unique-id.md"},"repository":{"provider":"github","viewUrl":"https://github.com/thomvaill/log4brains/blob/master/docs/adr/20201016-use-the-adr-slug-as-its-unique-id.md"}},"l4bVersion":"1.0.0-alpha.14"},"__N_SSG":true}
